      <h2>About Us</h2>
    <br>
      <p>Velabahleke was established for servicing Umkhumbane, a famous Black Shack-settlement (Cato manor), on the outskirts of the city of Durban. However, due to the notorious Group Areas Act of 1950, the settlement was demolished and the school was then moved to Umlazi in 1964 where it is presently built. The school is almost surrounded by shacks from which it draws its learner population.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>A Brief History</h2>
      <br>
      <P>The school’s first Principal was Mr D. Zulu. By that time, it had only grades 5, 6 and 7. In the early 70’s under the new principal Mr M. Mzindle the school was upgraded into a Junior Secondary School. Sad to say, in 1989 Mr Mzindle left for a better world because he could not withstand political strain because of his ill health. In 1990 a young new principal Mr M.T. Mtshali was appointed to take charge of the school. Besides being tasked with bringing back stability to the school, he was also charged with the task of upgrading the school physically and academically. Initially, the school had only ten classes, now it has seventeen additional classes, and one administration block. The School has since converted two classrooms, one into a library and the other into a computer class. Mr M. Mtshali in December 2015 after having fathered and served this institution for 25 years. The school will always be grateful to him for his profound remarkable contribution. In January 2016 to December 2016, Mr Z.T. Siyothula was appointed an Acting Principal of the school and he continued to maintain the school’s culture of its academic excellence. In December 2016, Mr B.C. Mhlongo was officially appointed to take charge of the school.</P>
